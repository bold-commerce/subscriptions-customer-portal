# Subscriptions Customer Portal

## Description

This open-source project serves as a starting point for developers creating a customer portal from scratch that is integrated with Bold Subscriptions.

## Platform Examples

We split out the example platforms via branches, each branch contains an example built for that platform. Even though we may not list a particular platform, any platform can be a great reference to building your customer portal.
